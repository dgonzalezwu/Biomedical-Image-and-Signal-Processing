# Biomedical-Image-and-Signal-Processing
A collection of software projects made during a course that focused on fundamental medical imaging and biomedical signal processing methods. 

## Lab-1 
Sampled and discretized sine waves and an image. The results of these operations are presented in figures. 

## Lab-2
Generated real-valued/complex-valued sinusoidal signals and performed discrete fourier transforms, sampling, and downsampling on the generated signals. The results of these operations are presented in figures. 

## Lab-3
Recorded a sound signal and performed discrete fourier transforms and filtering on it. The results of these operations are presented in figures. 

## Lab-4
Collected a signal from a generated waveform and filtering circuit, then calculated the average impulse response using it. The results of these operations are presented in figures. 

## Lab-5
Generated sinusoidal signals inputs, then filtered and/or added noise to them to create new signals. Afterwards, all of these signals were used to measure the magnitude and phase response of a moving average filter. The results of these operations are presented in figures. 

## Lab-6
Collected sinusoidal signals and used the impulse response from Lab-4 to create a moving average filter. Afterwards, all the sinusoidal signals were used to measure the magnitude and phase response of the created filter. The results of these operations are presented in figures. 

## Lab-7
Created wave patterns that were generated from a varying number of radial points and/or different wavelengths. Afterwards, altered these wave patterns in order to create the narrowest possible beam, a focus point at a desired location, and a phase delay of a specified angle. The results of these operations are presented in figures.
